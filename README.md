Target platform: android on mobile   
Game Engine used to make it: Unity   
Plans:
- Move the ball by rotating the phone using the accelerometer   
- Click screen or button to throw the ball   
- Still able to move ball by rotating the phone but also backwards and forwards to slow and speed up the ball   
- Free to play as all of the games I looked at were   
- To return back to the main menu, you have to watch an ad
